# count-down-3d

This is an opening video of a special internal event. In this project I used Three.js together with ES6, [MX6](https://github.com/MagicCube/mx6) and other open source technologies to create visual effects.
The idea is to use a bunch of balls to illustrate the counting-down animation and a [special image](https://github.com/MagicCube/count-down-3d/blob/master/server/public/images/logo.png) in the end.
